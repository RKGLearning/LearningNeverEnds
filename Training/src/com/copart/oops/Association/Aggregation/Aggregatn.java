/*
Special form of Association where :
1. it represents Has-A relationship.
2. it is a unidirectional association i.e. a one way relationship. For example, department can have students but vice
 versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
3. In Aggregation , both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not effect the other
 entity.
