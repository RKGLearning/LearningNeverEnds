/*
Encapsulation in java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example capsule i.e
mixed of severl medicines.

we can createa fully encapsulated class in java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use
setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

the Java Bean class is the example of fully encapsulated class.

ADVANTAGE OF ENCAPSULATION IN JAVA

1. By providing only setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only.
2. it provides you the control over the data. Suppose you want to set the value of id i.e. greater than 100 only, you
 can write the logic inside the setter method.
