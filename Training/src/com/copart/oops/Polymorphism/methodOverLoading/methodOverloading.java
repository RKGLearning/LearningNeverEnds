/*
 * Method Overloading : If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as
 * Method Overloading.
 * if we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increase the readability of the program.
 * Suppose you have to perform addition of the given numbers but there can be any number of arguments, if you write
 * the method such as a(int,int) for two parameters, and b(int,int,int) for three parameters then it may be difficult
 * for you as well as other programmers to understand the behavior of the method because its name differs.
 *
 * So, we perform method overloading to figure out the program quickly.
 * Advantage of method overloading :
 *   Method overloading increases the readability of the program.
 *
 *   Different ways to overload the method:
 *   1. by Changing number of arguments.
 *   2. by changing the data type.
 *
 *
 * Can we overload java main() method ?
 * Yes, by method overiding. You can have any number of main methods in a class by method overloading. But JVM calls
 * rakesh.practice.programs.master.training.Main() method which receives string array arguments only. Lets See the sample example:
